# Disordered waveguide design using double guided generative adversarial network under agent guidances.


### This is the following up project of generative model for multi-purposes inverse design disordered waveguides, we reconstruct the whole project. The RL is into as a supervisor into the generator along with Critc to double guiding the generation processes.

### Aim of the project is finding consistent generation of disordered, spare type of waveguide geometries that understand nonlinear chaotic dynamic in light propagation in chaotic waveguides.
