# Enhanced Disordered Waveguide Inverse Design Using a Generative Adversarial Network with Agent-Guided Integration for Nonlinear Conditioned Geometries Generation


### This is the follow-up project of a generative model for multi-purpose inverse design disordered waveguides, we reconstruct the whole project. The RL is a supervisor in the generator along with Critic to double guide the generation processes.

### The aim of the project is to find a consistent generation of disordered, spare type of waveguide geometries that understand the nonlinear chaotic dynamics in light propagation in nonlinear regimes
